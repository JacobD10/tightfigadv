# tightfigadv (Tight Figure Advanced)
A MATLAB function to remove white space around figures

This function is inspired by, and is an extension of, [tightfig()](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34055-tightfig) by [Richard Crozier](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1590682-richard-crozier).
The updated function is able to find outer bounds of legends, colorbars and moved text objects.

Future additions may include support for positioning of annotations, tick labels and tick label exponents.
